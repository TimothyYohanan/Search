the final two queries in the search take up the bulk of the query time, and they are slowest when the input is 1 or 2 characters.
combining the final two queries with a JOIN statement should improve the overall query speed.

To acheive target execution speeds, I may need to pool 2-3 connections to the database.

the sorting method used to rank search results is a placeholder for application-specific methods.
the placeholder functions are:
    Search::calculateParagraphScores()
	Search::rankParagraphs()
	Search::rankParagraphIds()
